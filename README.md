# Towers-of-Hanoi-AI
A program that tests how efficiently an AI can solve the Towers of Hanoi puzzle based on either the A* or Recursive-Best-First Search algorithms using three different heuristic functions. 


Instructions for running The Towers of Hanoi with A* and RBFS Search:

1) Create a new CodeBlocks Console Application Project in the directory, but make sure to NOT allow the program to overwrite the 'main.cpp' file in the directory. Naming conventions for project submission will likely prevent this. If a new main.cpp file is created by CodeBlocks, it should be safe to delete it. 

2) Add files manually through the CodeBlocks IDE on the same directory level. 

3) Check header files to make sure that they will Link and Compile during the build process by right-clicking the file, selecting 'Options' and making sure to check both options for 'Compile file' and 'Link file'. 

4) Build and Run project

5) Follow the prompts to run the program. To specify a heuristic when prompted, enter '1' for h1, '2' for h2, and '3' for h3. To specify the search to run, enter 'A' for A* Search or 'R' for RBFS.
